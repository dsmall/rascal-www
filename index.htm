                <h2>What is the Rascal and why do I need one?</h2>
                <p>The Rascal is a small computer that you can use to monitor and control the world remotely. It's like the brains of an iPhone, without the corporate overlord.</p>
                <h2>Why the Rascal?</h2>
                <p>Maybe you played with legos or erector sets as a kid. Maybe you just got into hacking electronics recently. Either way, you're one of the pioneers of a new era. Instead of saying, "They should make one of those that connects to the internet," you do it yourself.</p>

            <div id="righttorso">
                <h2>Internet native</h2>
                <p>The Rascal is like the Arduino or other single-board computers, but it's designed to live on the web. The Rascal is powerful enough to handle real web traffic, but you don't have to be a professional electrical engineer to use one.</p>
                <h2>Open source</h2>
                <p>The Rascal is built from the ground up with open source technologies. The hardware, designed by Rascal Micro, is available to you for free under a Creative Commons license. The software consists of the Linux kernel, the GNU tools, and a host of higher level languages and tools, all available under various free licenses.</p>

                <h2>Can I steal the design?</h2>
                <p>I'm giving you the design, so no, technically you can't steal it. If you want to make your own version of the Rascal, or use it in a commercial product, go ahead. Seriously, do it. I'll never saturate the market for devices like the Rascal, and I'm already working on the next design anyway.
