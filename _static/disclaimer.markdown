## Disclaimer of liability ##

The Rascal is designed for you to connect weird stuff to the internet, but you need some technical expertise to use it. By itself, the Rascal is pretty safe-- it's like any other low voltage device that you plug into the wall. But, because the Rascal is intended to be a component in a larger system, using the Rascal usually involves working with electricity, wires, tools, robots, and the like. This can range from safe to extremely dangerous. Before using the Rascal, you should make sure that whatever you are attempting to do will be safe. If you can't do it safely, you should *not* just do it anyway and hope to get away with it. You should stop and come up with a safe plan.

## Electricity is dangerous ##

This is not a list of all dangers, but the big danger we here at Rascal Micro worry about is you working with high voltage. That stuff can kill you, if you're not careful, and sometimes even if you are. Do not go into the basement by yourself and try wiring the Rascal into your electrical panel-- that way lies death. Find someone experienced in working safely with electricity and ask them to help you.

## Your privacy is at risk ##

You should also be careful about the security of your home computer network and your family's privacy. For example, if you connect a webcam to the Rascal and then connect the Rascal to the internet, people on the internet will be able to see whatever the webcam sees. You should be careful about that.

## In complex systems, things can go wrong ##

Modern microcontroller systems like the Rascal are complex, as are global computer networks like the Internet. We've tested the Rascal for months, but even so, it could fail. Your Internet connection could fail. The Rascal could get hacked. The power could go out. Don't put yourself in the situation where if some part of your system fails, someone could get hurt, or someone's property could be damaged-- that would be imprudent.

## Be safe ##

To repeat: please be safe. If you can't do what you want safely, you should stop and come up with a safe plan.

By using the Rascal, you're on the cutting edge of open source hardware development-- you're one of the pioneers of a new era. Part of being a pioneer is accepting liability for the risks that you're taking. To the extent that you try to attach dangerous things to the Rascal, we can't be held responsible.

To put in the legal terms that lawyers prefer: the Rascal and related products are provided to you "as is" without warranty of any kind. We hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with regard to the information, software, products, and services you receive from Rascal Micro, including all implied warranties and conditions of security, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied with these terms, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Rascal.
