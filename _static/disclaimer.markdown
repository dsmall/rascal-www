The Rascal is designed for you to connect weird stuff to the internet. By itself, the Rascal is pretty safe-- it's like any other low voltage appliance that you plug into the wall. But, because the Rascal is intended to be a component in a larger system, using the Rascal usually involves working with electricity, wires, tools, robots, and the like. This can range from safe to extremely dangerous. Before using the Rascal, you should make sure that whatever you are attempting to do will be safe. If you can't do it safely, you shouldn't just do it anyway and hope to get away with it; you should come up with a safe plan.

## Electricity is dangerous ##

This is not a list of all dangers, but the big danger we here at Rascal Micro worry about is you working with high voltage. That stuff can kill you, if you're not careful, and sometimes even if you are. Do not go into the basement by yourself and try wiring the Rascal into your electrical panel-- that way lies death. Find someone experienced in working safely with electricity and ask them to help you.

## Your privacy is at risk ##

You should also be careful about the security of your home computer network and your family's privacy. For example, if you connect a webcam to the Rascal and then connect the Rascal to the internet, people on the internet will be able to see whatever the webcam sees. You should be careful about that.

## In complex systems, things can go wrong ##

Modern microcontroller systems like the Rascal are complex, as are global computer networks like the Internet. We've tested the Rascal for months, but even so, it could fail. Your Internet connection could fail. The Rascal could get hacked. The power could go out. Don't put yourself in the situation where if some part of your system fails, someone could get hurt, or someone's property could be damaged-- that would be imprudent.

## Be safe ##

To repeat: please be safe. If you can't do what you want safely, you should come up with a safe plan. To the extent that you try to attach dangerous things to the Rascal, we can't be held responsible.
