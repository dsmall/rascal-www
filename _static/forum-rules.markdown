## Use of online web communities ##

If any Rascal Micro Site contains bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively, "Communities"), User agrees to use the Communities only to send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular Forum. By way of example, and not as a limitation, User agrees that when using a Community, User shall not:
•	Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten, or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.
•	Publish, post, upload, distribute, or disseminate any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent, or unlawful topic, name, material or information.
•	Upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy of publicity) unless User owns or controls the rights thereto or has received all necessary consents.
•	Upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer. 
•	Advertise or offer to sell any goods or services for any commercial purpose.
•	Conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes, or chain letters.
•	Download any file posted by another user of a Forum that User knows, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner.
•	Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal, or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded.
•	Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Communities. 
Rascal Micro reserves the right to terminate User's access to any or all of the Communities, at any time, without notice for any reason whatsoever.

Rascal Micro has no obligation to monitor the Communities. However, Rascal Micro reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Rascal Micro's sole discretion.

User acknowledges that all Communities are public and not private communications; therefore, User's communications may be read by others without User's knowledge. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about User or User's children in any Community. Rascal Micro does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Community and, therefore, Rascal Micro specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communities and any actions resulting from User's participation in any Community. Forum managers and hosts are not authorized Rascal Micro spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Rascal Micro. 

By posting messages, uploading files, inputting data, or engaging in any other form of communication through any Rascal Micro Site, User is granting Rascal Micro permission to:
1.	Use, modify, copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, publish, sublicense, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any such communication; and
2.	Sublicense to third parties the unrestricted right to exercise any of the foregoing rights granted with respect to the communication. 

The foregoing grants shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such communication, including but not limited to rights under copyright, trademark, service mark, or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction.

User agrees to (as available) send and receive electronic mail, engage in conferences and chats, download and upload files, and otherwise use any Rascal Micro Site only as permitted by these Terms of Use, any additional policies or procedures published in any Rascal Micro Site from time to time by Rascal Micro, and in accordance with applicable law.

Rascal Micro reserves the right for any reason to remove without notice any contents of any Rascal Micro Site received from User, including without limitation bulletin board postings. Rascal Micro reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, User access to any Rascal Micro Site or any portion thereof without notice.

User acknowledges that chats, conferences, bulletin boards, and any other such communications forums hosted by any Rascal Micro Site are public and not private communications. Further, User acknowledges that chats, postings, conferences, and other communications by other users are not endorsed by Rascal Micro, and such communications shall not be considered reviewed, screened, or approved by Rascal Micro.
