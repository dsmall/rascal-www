## Getting started with the Rascal ##

This eight minute video demonstrates web-based editing with the Rascal. It's a good place to start if you're unfamiliar with the Rascal.

### Plugging the Rascal in ###

The Rascal needs two connections to do anything useful-- an Ethernet cable and a power cable. Plug in the Ethernet cable first so that it will be ready to go when the Rascal starts. After you plug in the power, the Rascal will take around 25 seconds to boot. It might take a little more time depending on how fast it gets assigned an IP address on your network.

As soon as the Linux kernel is up and running, the Rascal will turn off one of the green LEDs on the board (the one that is *not* next to the power jack).

After that, it will take a few seconds to start its web interface.

### The web interface ###

There's a sticker on the bottom of your Rascal that tells you the Bonjour address of your Rascal. (Bonjour is a protocol, created by Apple, used by printers to announce themselves on a network. It works natively on OS X and Linux; if you're running Windows, you'll want to install Bonjour for Windows.)

More details soon . . .
