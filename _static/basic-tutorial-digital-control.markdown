(This tutorial is not done yet.)

We grow tomatoes in pots in our backyard in the summer. A couple of years ago, I built a basic irrigation system using a crappy battery-powered sprinkler controller. For the next iteration, I want to be able to turn the sprinkler on and off through the internet, using the Rascal.

The idea is to switch [this solenoid valve][1] and [24 V AC power supply][2] on and off using a [relay][3] controlled by a digital pin on the Rascal.
