## Debugging Rascal 1.1, March 2012 ##

### The background ###

Rascal 1.1 is a new revision of the Rascal PCB. The functionality is 95% the same; the biggest changes are switching from the Micrel KSZ8041 to the KSZ8051RNL ethernet PHY and adding a second USB host port. All capacitors were changed from 1206 packages to 0603. I have just assembled the first two PCBs. All of the changes work as expected, but there appears to be a new problem.

### The problem ###

The new boards reboot unexpectedly while Linux is attempting to boot. Additionally, a similar reboot can sometimes be induced by executing the command:

<code>git clone git://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2.git</code>

It appears that the reset is controlled by the processor. The oscilloscope capture below shows four lines:

1. yellow: processor reset line, NRST, at connector J4
2. blue: 3.3 V bus at connector J4
3. pink: 5.0 V bus at connector J4
4. green: 1.0 V bus next to L5

<img class="span12" src="/img/reset-with-power-supplies-2012-03-08.png">

From this, it looks like the power supply voltages are steady and the reset is controlled.

### When the resets happen ###

 * The resets rarely or never happen when the processor is idle.
 
 * Unplugging the ethernet cable appears to make no difference; resets still occur.
 
 * The resets do not appear at *random* times during boot. The table below lists some statistics on when they occur. The full boot message appears at the bottom of this page for context.
 
 * In general, the kernel tends to make it further each time it boots. This isn't strictly true, but it's at least a weak tendency.

### Appears to be related to memory errors ###

My fellow Artisan's Asylum denizen, Edison G., has been helping me with the debugging. Noticing that the resets seemed to only occur after U-boot passed control to the Linux kernel, Edison suggested that we try making the board reset under U-boot. Looking through the list of U-boot commands, the memory test command, <code>mtest</code> seemed like it might generate a decent load on the processor, so we gave it a try.

As it turns out, <code>mtest</code> reveals that the problem seems to be related to memory errors in the SDRAM on the board. The idea is that either the kernel gets written to RAM incorrectly, or instructions are read back incorrectly as they are executed. Faced with an invalid instruction, the processor does the only thing it can do, which is reset itself. Similar failures occur on both new boards but do not occur with an older board.

### Memory test results ###

The memory errors reported by U-boot look like this:

<pre>
    Mem error @ 0x202035F0: found 0008F209, expected FFF7F209

    Mem error @ 0x202035F4: found 0008F208, expected FFF7F208

    Mem error @ 0x202035F8: found 0008F207, expected FFF7F207

    Mem error @ 0x202035FC: found 0008F206, expected FFF7F206

    Mem error @ 0x20203600: found 0008F205, expected FFF7F205

    Mem error @ 0x20203604: found 0008F204, expected FFF7F204
    Pattern 00000080  Writing...  Reading...
</pre>

There's a pattern to the errors: the two lower bytes are correct, but the two upper bytes are the inverse of what they should be (0x0008 instead of 0xFFF7, and note that 0xFFF7 + 0x0008 = 0xFFFF). This pattern appears most of the time. Sometimes, the found value is exactly the inverse of the expected value.

The <code>mtest</code> program writes to every RAM address alternating values from each end of the range of 32 bits, i.e. this sequence: 0xFFFFFFFF, 0x00000000, 0xFFFFFFFE, 0x00000001, . . ., but incrementing the value written by 1 for each memory location as it crosses the address space. The [memory test code][1] is on Github.

The fact that the data read back is the inverse of what we expect, with errors along byte boundaries, rather than random corruption, suggests that the problem is a timing issue, rather than a data or address problem.

### Theories about what could be wrong ###

 * The new, smaller capacitors have less capacitance, and as a result, one of the power supplies is sagging and inducing a reset. Doesn't appear to be the case from the scope image above, but maybe the scope is missing small glitches closer to the processor, or maybe they happen more than 20 ms before the reset. I tried soldering 1 uF caps on top of C21 and C29, and adding a 10 uF cap across pins 27-28 of U5.

 * (Edison's theory) The processor thinks it's hotter than it really it is and is going into thermal shutdown.
 
 * It has something to do with the PHY getting reset, incorrectly reinitialized by the kernel after U-boot releases it, or something like that. It's not clear how the PHY could make the processor reset.
 
 * The memory chips on the new boards are from the same batch as the ones on the old boards, but they spent a humid summer sitting in a closet. While in the closet, they absorbed moisture, which turned to steam when they were run through a reflow oven without a dessication step ahead of time. This damaged the chips in some way. It's somewhat plausible, but it doesn't explain why the memory errors have the same peculiar characteristics on both boards. Could try desoldering two chips and soldering in chips from the new batch.
 
 * Perhaps U-boot's ALT_MEMTEST would give more information (though this wouldn't help if it's a timing issue, which it appears to be).

* Try running the board in a very warm or very cold box and see if the problem persists.
