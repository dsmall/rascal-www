title: First Anthrax release candidate available
categories: rascal
---
The first release candidate for Anthrax is now available for download. This is basically a new collection of software for the microSD card in your Rascal. (All Rascal software releases are named after infectious diseases.)

Anthrax should be compatible with all existing Rascals, though this release candidate has only been tested on pre-release Rascal 1.2's. The point of release candidates is to test the software before we send it out to newly-minted Rascal zealots, so please let us know if you run into difficulties with Anthrax.

More details are on the [Anthrax release page][1].

### Quick update on the status of Rascal 1.2 ###

As of June 22, 2012, we're waiting for Ethernet jacks, which will allegedly ship on June 25th. Predicting the future has historically been a dicey activity for humans, so we'll omit fictive speculation here.
